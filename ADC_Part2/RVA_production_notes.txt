RVA Composite Production Notes - 4/09/08
(For Part 2, and Part 3)

Mandrel Preparation
----------------------

   1/ After leveling, the mandrel needs to be rotated back 90
degrees. The flat side of the mandrel is rotated away from the
operator, and an edge faces the operator.
   2/ Temperature: 600 C
   3/ Pressure: Lowest, 100 lb
   4/ Tension needs to be ON.

   5/ Mandrel Reinforcement: 2-3 single strip wraps need to be added
at even intervals in the center of the manrel (To prevent bowing).
Eye-ball the even intervals.

       Load: TRI_RVA_5Wrap
       Details: This is a single ply at 0 degrees, single strip file
that places a tight hoop at the home position.  It will be 5 Wraps
around the mandrel.

   6/ Offset the robot to -8 inches from the standard 0 position at
the left end of the mandrel.  This is the farthest limit to the LEFT that the Robot will tape to.

(You will see the scars on the mandrel where the part begins.)

Part Production
----------------------

   1/ End-Caps:  Two hoops will be added for the strips to begin and
end on either end of the mandrel.
       Load: TRI_RVA_CAPS_4_5
       Details: 2 strips at 0 degrees, the left one is first, and the
right one is second.

   2/  Production Part (Part 2):
       Load: SILVER_RVA_80to3_O3_OFFSET_FIX
       Details: 6 strips at a varing degrees. Strips alternate taping directions, from
the left to the right, then from the right to the left.  
Please clean the roller of the robot before each ply.

   3/ Axial Corner Strips:
       Load: SILVER_RVA_AXIAL_NEW
       Details: These are 3 strips at 90 degrees, one on each of the edges of the
mandrel moving from left to right. Strips will over run the part, and the extra material can be trimmed.
