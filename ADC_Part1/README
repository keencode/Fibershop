ADC Composite Part 1 Fall 2009
- Final Part 12/18/2009 

This repository contains the production files for the graduated graphite manual Part 1 for ADC produced Fall 2009.  It was developed utilizing Rhino/RhinoScript files based originally on the WrappingTool.  

Originally two parts were intended to be produced:
  V1 - which is "Part 1" and was produced, was a graduated graphite mandrel.
  	Latest Development File(s): V1_*.3dm

  V2 - no produced (known as "Part 2") was a plaster twisted mandrel.
	Latest Development File: V2_020.3dm 

Part 1 (V1) production
  For the composite wrapping production of Part 1, two wrapping systems were developed: 
  
  1. "Tape" - collection of RhinoScript files based on the WrappingTool, which wraps a single Ply at a time.  This approach was NOT used to build the final Part 1 due to the intractability of attaining symmetry between the two plys.

	Latest Development File: V1_044.3dm

  2. "Scaffold" - collection of RhinoScipt, re-written from scratch, which first builds a symmetrical scaffold of points which are projected to the mandrel surface to yield the final wrapped pattern.  This approach was used to produce the final part.

	Latest Development File: V1_SYM_MOVE_036.3dm

Workflow for the Part 1 Production

1. Utilize a copy of V1_SYM_MOVE_036.3dm with Rhino 4
2. Get the Rhino Monkey Script Editor for Rhino 4 
   (http://wiki.mcneel.com/developer/monkeyforrhino4)
3. Open the scripts from the Scaffold folder in the Monkey Editor in Rhino.
4. Make sure that all layers are VISIBLE (all lightbulbs in the layers are visible)
5. Run the scripts in alphabetical order (described further in Scaffold dir).
